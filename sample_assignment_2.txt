Assignment: ER Diagram Design
Course: CS202 - Database Management
Student: Arjun Sharma (STU001)

1. Introduction

This assignment presents the design of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a University Management System. The system manages students, faculty, courses, departments, and enrollments. The goal is to create a normalized database schema that supports the core operations of a university.

2. Entities Identified

2.1 Student
- StudentID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- DateOfBirth
- Address
- EnrollmentDate
- DepartmentID (Foreign Key)

2.2 Faculty
- FacultyID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Specialization
- JoiningDate
- DepartmentID (Foreign Key)

2.3 Course
- CourseID (Primary Key)
- CourseName
- Credits
- Semester
- DepartmentID (Foreign Key)

2.4 Department
- DepartmentID (Primary Key)
- DepartmentName
- HOD_FacultyID (Foreign Key)
- Building
- Phone

2.5 Enrollment
- EnrollmentID (Primary Key)
- StudentID (Foreign Key)
- CourseID (Foreign Key)
- Semester
- Grade
- EnrollmentDate

3. Relationships

- A Student BELONGS TO one Department (Many-to-One)
- A Faculty BELONGS TO one Department (Many-to-One)
- A Course is OFFERED BY one Department (Many-to-One)
- A Student ENROLLS IN many Courses through Enrollment (Many-to-Many)
- A Faculty TEACHES many Courses (One-to-Many)
- A Department is HEADED BY one Faculty (One-to-One)

4. Cardinality Summary

| Relationship | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| Student - Department | M:1 | Many students in one department |
| Faculty - Department | M:1 | Many faculty in one department |
| Student - Course | M:N | Via Enrollment table |
| Faculty - Course | 1:M | One faculty teaches many courses |
| Department - HOD | 1:1 | One head per department |

5. Normalization

The schema is in Third Normal Form (3NF):
- 1NF: All attributes are atomic, no repeating groups
- 2NF: All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key
- 3NF: No transitive dependencies exist

6. Conclusion

The ER diagram successfully models the core entities and relationships of a university management system. The design supports student enrollment tracking, course management, faculty assignments, and departmental organization. The schema is normalized to 3NF to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Future enhancements could include adding entities for Examination, Library, and Fee Management modules.
