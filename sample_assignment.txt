1. Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains a data field and a reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations.

In this lab, I implemented both singly and doubly linked lists in Java, with full support for insert, delete, and search operations.

2. Singly Linked List Implementation

A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node has a data part and a pointer to the next node. The last node points to null.

Operations implemented:
- insertAtHead(data): Inserts a new node at the beginning. Time complexity: O(1)
- insertAtTail(data): Inserts a new node at the end. Time complexity: O(n)
- insertAtPosition(data, pos): Inserts at a specific position. Time complexity: O(n)
- deleteByValue(data): Removes the first occurrence of a value. Time complexity: O(n)
- search(data): Returns true if value exists. Time complexity: O(n)
- display(): Prints all elements. Time complexity: O(n)

The singly linked list uses O(n) space where n is the number of elements.

3. Doubly Linked List Implementation

A doubly linked list extends the singly linked list by adding a pointer to the previous node. This allows traversal in both directions.

Additional operations:
- insertBefore(node, data): Insert before a given node. Time complexity: O(1) if node reference is given
- deleteNode(node): Delete a specific node. Time complexity: O(1) if node reference is given
- reverseTraversal(): Print list from tail to head. Time complexity: O(n)

The doubly linked list uses slightly more memory (O(n) extra for prev pointers) but provides O(1) deletion when the node reference is available.

4. Testing and Results

I tested both implementations with the following test cases:
- Inserting 10 elements and verifying order
- Deleting head, tail, and middle elements
- Searching for existing and non-existing elements
- Edge cases: empty list operations, single element list

All test cases passed successfully.

5. Conclusion

Linked lists are fundamental data structures that provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions compared to arrays. The singly linked list is simpler and uses less memory, while the doubly linked list offers more flexibility with bidirectional traversal and O(1) deletion.

Through this lab, I gained a deeper understanding of pointer manipulation, memory management, and the trade-offs between different data structure implementations.
